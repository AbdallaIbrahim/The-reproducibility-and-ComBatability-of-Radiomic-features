This project is on the analysis of the reproducibility and ComBatability of radiomic features using a phantom dataset. A 10-layer phantom was scanned using different acquisition and reconstruction settings on different imaging vendors. The reproducibility and the applicability of ComBat harmonization (ComBatability) or radiomic features were assess by measuring the concordance correlation coefficient in each of the investigated scenarios.
The imaging data is publicly available on: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/Credence+Cartridge+Radiomics+Phantom+CT+Scans
The code provided here can be used to assess the imapact of different parameters and harmonization methods on radiomic features and not limited solely to ComBat harmonization.
